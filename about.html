        <p> Ever since I was young, I've had an affinity for art, finding joy and expression through creativity. My chosen medium has been graphite drawings, where I've honed my skills and developed my unique style. I have mainly focused on pet portraits as of late, using colored pencils to capture the essence and personality of each subject. Recently, I've been exploring other mediums such as charcoal, oil pastels, and acrylic painting, and expanding into new art themes like landscapes and abstract art. As an up-and-coming artist, I continue to work diligently on my art, hoping to reach and inspire diverse audiences with my evolving creations.</p>
